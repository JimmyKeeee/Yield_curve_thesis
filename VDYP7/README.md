VDYP 7 files go here. License terms do not allow us to distribute VDYP7 files directly from the GitHub repository, so you will need to [download VDYP7](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/software/vdyp/vdyp7setup7-33b.exe), run the installer on a Windows machine,  and then copy the files to this directory. There is likely a way to extract all the required files directly from the exe setup file (e.g., using `wine` extract function, `7zr`, `cabextract`, etc.), but we have not had time to figure that part out yet.
